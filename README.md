# API Authentification App

Hi ! My name is Day, i'm a junior developper and this is my API Node.js project for my [React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The DB was build with MongoDB.

Don't forget to configure your config/.env file:
### `PORT="5000"`
### `CLIENT_URL="http://localhost:3000/"`
### `DB_USERNAME=<your_DB_username>`
### `DB_PASSWORD=<your_DB_password>`
### `JWT_SECRET=<your_JWT_secret>`


For install, run:

### `npm i`

In the project directory, run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.


### Deployment

This project is deployed on Heroku but it doesn't really work. I need more time for debug the JWT Cookies ='(.

**Note: If you have a response to my problem, contact me ;)**
